## Jason R. Schmidt Avendaño

### Data report Introduction
My name is **Jason R. Schmidt Avendaño**. These data come from an eye tracking study. 
Each participant reads multiple sentences, each of which have a particular target 
word in them. Words are either a high frequency word or a low frequency word. 

For example, item 1 was:
The boy found a red phone on his way to school. (High frequency version)
The boy found a red scarf on his way to school. (Low frequency version)

Researchers measured fixation time on the target word (i.e., either phone or scarf) to see 
how easy it was to recognize each of those words (more frequently occurring words 
should be easier to recognize and lead to shorter fixation times).

### Variables 
In these data, 
`subjet` is the participant id, 
`item` is the setence id, 
`fixation_time` is how long it took the the participant to fixate on the word (ms),
and `word_frequency` is whether the word is a high-frequency or low-frequency word.
